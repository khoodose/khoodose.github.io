      <strong>What are the benefits of version control?</strong>
      <br><br>When teams collaborate on writing a program, or even when just one or two individuals build something complicated, it's easy for new code or components of the program to cause complications for older code.

      <br><br>Different developers may work on the same bit of the program, leading to unintentional conflicts or differences in their code.  And even if there are no conflicts, imagine a situation where all the original developers who wrote a program have left.  What if new developers who join the team wish to find out about what past changes were and why they were made?

      <br><br>Version control software like Git allows us to track past changes and the reasons or for these changes, often contained in "commit messages".  Teams can also track and review live what changes are being made by their developers on their own tracks or "branches" before these are all combined or "merged" together into the main program called the "master".

      <strong>How does git help you keep track of changes?</strong>
      <br><br>There are several ways that git helps you keep track of changes.  Firstly, changes are go through different stages before they become official.  When you make edits to code, you will need to add, commit and push in separate steps to your main base of code or repository (repo for short). This allows you to take it in steps and also remove or unstage your unwanted changes.
      Changes placed under different "commits" act as different versions so we can review them if there are complications later.

      <br><br>The above applies to your teammates too, so everyone on the team can then look into the changes collectively being made.  There are many useful commands like git log and git status to help you check your progress.
    </p>

      <strong>Why use GitHub to store your code?</strong>
      <br><br>GitHub is a great social utility for developers.  It allows teams to collaborate and easily view changes, versions and commit messages in a graphical interface.  Users can check differences before merging different branches to the master.  Public repositories are free, which is an additional benefit if you don't have anything that's too sensitive and needs to be made private.
