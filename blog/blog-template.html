    Q: How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

    A: It was fine.  We took turns with driver and navigator and we were able to discuss any necessary edits as we went along.


    Q: Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

    A: Yes.  Especially with remote collaboration too.  Then everyone can be on the same page and also use the wireframe to discuss features we've seen elsewhere that we think would be good to incorporate.


    Q: What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

    A: Something simple that represents what we want to create and leaves room for future additions


    Q: What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

    A: Considered but haven't used button and nav
